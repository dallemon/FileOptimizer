2 DESCRIPTION
=============

The main purpose of this utility is to recompress and test
the zip archives to get the smallest possible size.

For recompression the libdeflate implementation is used.
This implementation generally gives 5-10% more compression
than the zLib Deflate implementation, and it's also
generally faster.

For experimental purpose also the 7-Zip LZMA algorithm is
available with the -N option. In this case, the generated
zips WILL NOT BE USABLE by any other program. To make
them usable you need to recompress them without the -N
option. Generally this algorithm gives 10-20% more
compression than the zLib Deflate implementation.


3 OPTIONS
=========

    -a, --add ARCHIVE FILES...
        Create the specified archive with the specified
        files. You must specify only one archive.

    -x, --extract ARCHIVE
        Extract all the files on the specified archive. You
        must specify only one archive.

    -l, --list ARCHIVES...
        List the content of the specified archives.

    -z, --recompress ARCHIVES...
        Recompress the specified archives. If the -1, -2,
        -3, -4 options are specified, it's used the smallest file
        choice from: the previous compressed data, the new
        compression and the uncompressed format. If the -0
        option is specified the archive is always rewritten
        without any compression.

    -t, --test ARCHIVES...
        Test the specified archives. The tests may be
        extended with the -p option.

    -k, --keep-file-time
        When recompressing with -z keep the .zip file time.

    -p, --pedantic
        Be pedantic on the zip tests. If this flag is
        enabled some more extensive tests on the zip
        integrity are done. These tests are generally not
        done by other zip utilities.

    -0, --shrink-store
        Disable the compression. The file is
        only stored and not compressed. This option is
        very useful to expand the archives of .png and .mp3
        files. These files are already compressed, trying to
        compress them another time is really a waste of time
        and resource.

    -1, --shrink-fast
        Set the compression level to "fast" using the zlib
        compressor.

    -2, --shrink-normal
        Set the compression level to "normal" using the libdeflate
        compressor.
        This is the default level of compression.

    -3, --shrink-extra
        Set the compression level to "extra" using the 7z
        compressor.
        You can define the compressor iterations with
        the -i, --iter option.

    -4, --shrink-insane
        Set the compression level to "insane" using the zopfli
        compressor.
        You can define the compressor iterations with
        the -i, --iter option.

    -i, --iter N
        Define an additional numer of iterations for the 7z and zopfli
        compressors for modes -3 and -4.
        More iterations usually give a better compression, but may
        require a lot more time.
        Try for example with 10, 15, 20, and so on.
