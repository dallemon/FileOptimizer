<body><STRONG>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</STRONG> <BR><EM>Why are 
several downloads available?</EM> <BR>  Available 
downloads come separated in a binaries (executables) form, suitable for x86 and 
x64 architectures, and in a source code archive. Both are usually available in 
several package formats. 
<P></P>
<P><EM>What is the sense of FileOptimizer, if standalone tools are already 
available? </EM><BR><EM>Indeed you can manually execute the commandline tools 
that FileOptimizer uses as plugins, but this will be probably less comfortable. 
Specially if you consider you will need to execute one or another depending on 
the file format, and to chain some of them to obtain best results.</EM>         
           
              
             </P>
<P><EM>What is different in FileOptimizer compared to similar tools? 
</EM><BR><EM>General idea on tools like PNGGauntlet, ImageOptim, 
RIOT, etc is esentially the same.<BR>FileOptimizer is built-in with lots of 
plugins that allow it to handle a big variety of file formats. Optimized files 
are usually smaller than in competing products, or comparable at worst. It is 
easy to use, and at the same time easy to automate. Is a native Win32 
application, being compact and fast, and works portable with no external 
dependencies nor access to the system registry. Finally it is free and 
opensource.<BR>At the moment, it is not much mature, lacks some features, and is 
not configurable at all.</EM>     
            </P>
<P><EM>Are optimized files identical to the original ones? <BR></EM>Optimized files, will look 
identical to the original ones, but internally they will be different in order 
to achieve the size reduction.<BR>For images, bit depth 
reduction is used when possible. For instance an image encoded with 24 bit color 
depth could be resampled to 8 bit color depth if 256 colors of less are used. 
Quality should not be affected after the transformation. </P>
<P><EM>Have the optimized files same degree of compatibility as the original 
ones? <BR></EM>Generally yes, they have the same degree of compatibility. The 
exception is JPEG images, when you have enabled the &lt;i&gt;User arithmetic encoding&lt;/i&gt; 
option. It generates smallest files with the same quality, but require 
recent software to render them. </P>
<P><EM>Will optimized files load faster? </EM><BR><EM>Definitively yes, optimized files are 
smaller, less information needs to be transferred from the internet, of from the 
local disk, and will load faster in a direct proportion with the size 
reduction.<BR>Decompression speed of the optimized files is also proportional to 
the size reduction, because used compression algorithms are asymmetric (slow 
compression and fast decompression).</EM>            
         
   </P>
<P><EM>Does optimized files work on other platforms than Windows? <BR></EM>Yes, 
since they are the same format as the original ones, they will continue to work, 
no matter if they are rendered in a web browser, an Android or iOS application, 
or any other desktop program. </P>
<P><EM>Why is the recompression process so slow? </EM><BR><EM>The speed of the 
recompression depends on the particular format of the file.<BR>Noticeably PNG 
processing is the slowest, because the brute-force recompression to squeeze 
them. As oposite, PDF and JPEG files should be encoded pretty fast.</EM>  
          
            </P>
<P><EM>Does it work on other platforms than Windows? <BR></EM>FileOptimizer is reported to work in 
some environments under UNIX based operating systems with Wine.<BR>For other platforms, you will need to install a virtual machine such 
as VirtualBox with Windows XP or later. </P>
<P><EM>Why a particular format is not supported? </EM><BR><EM>Even if I do my best to add new 
format support to FileOptimizer, I may have missed some.<BR>If the format to add 
has available a Windows commandline tool to optimize it, it can be easily 
integrated on FileOptimizer, so please, let me know.</EM>  
               
         </P>
<P><EM>How can I disable a particular plugin? <BR></EM>Simply remove the desired plugin from 
the Plugins32 and Plugins64 folder, and FileOptimizer will not use it. </P>
<P><EM>Can I prevent certain file formats to be processed? <BR></EM>If they are supported by 
FileOptimizer, unless you could remove all the plugins used to treat this 
format, it will not be possible.<BR>The workaround would be 
to not add those type of files.&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>I can appreciate some quality loss on PDF 
optimization. Why? <BR></EM>PDF are recompressed with no loss of quality, but 
images can be downsampled, and so on, allow certain lost of quality, specially 
at high zoom levels. You can control it under Options -&gt; PDF -&gt; Profile.</P>
<P><EM>How is the command line syntax? 
</EM><BR>FileOptimizer command line arguments work like: 
<BR>C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\Win32\Release\FileOptimizer64.exe 
"C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\_Tests\_ - copia"\<BR>&nbsp;Where:<BR>&nbsp;- 
C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\Win32\Release\FileOptimizer64.exe: Is the full path 
where FileOptimizer executable is.<BR>&nbsp;- 
"C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\_Tests\_ - copia"\: Is the full path of the folder 
to recursively process. Be aware enclosing it with double quotes as in the 
example, which is Windows mandatory if the folder contains spaces, or extended 
characters.<BR>&nbsp;Alternatively you can specify only one single file instead 
of a 
folder:<BR>&nbsp;C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\Win32\Release\FileOptimizer64.exe 
"C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\_Tests\_ - 
copia\av-214_.zip"<BR>&nbsp;Where:<BR>&nbsp;- 
C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\Win32\Release\FileOptimizer64.exe: Is the full path 
where FileOptimizer executable is.<BR>&nbsp;- 
"C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\_Tests\_ - copia\av-214_.zip": Is the full path of 
the file to process.</FONT></P></body>
